# C++ Sensor Data Stream Project

This project simulates a sensor data stream that generates random temperature and humidity values. The application runs indefinitely, outputting the generated values to the console.

## Project Structure

```
cpp-project
├── src
│   └── main.cpp        # Main application code
├── include             # Directory for header files (currently empty)
├── Makefile            # Build instructions
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## Building the Project

To build the project, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```
make
```

This will compile the `main.cpp` file and create an executable.

## Running the Application

After building the project, you can run the application with the following command:

```
./main
```

The application will start streaming simulated sensor data to the console.

## Dependencies

This project uses the C++ standard library for threading and random number generation. No additional libraries are required.

## Future Improvements

- Implement a way to stop the data stream gracefully.
- Add more sensor parameters (e.g., pressure, light).
- Store the generated data in a file for later analysis.
